This is a placeholder for where files will be when python manage.py collectstatic is run. To run it for deployment on heroku, I had to turn off the bucket settings and storage settings (I just commented them out), then ran python manage.py collectstatic after running yarn run build. I then put the staticfiles in my Amazon S3 Bucket and put back the bucket and storage settings.
