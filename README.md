This is the production code (with some examples of the deployment code left in) that is deployed on heroku forÂ https://underwaterfortunes.com. The site gives random funny fortunes and uses Django, Django Rest Framework, React, Redux, Axios, etc. The site had a recent complete overhaul and runs faster now.

It was made using a Django backend which also included Django Rest Framework, and the frontend was made using React and a webpack.

Most of the images and static files were taken out when I uploaded this, so I left in placeholders.

I started the project in a virtual environment making the Django and Django Rest Framework api first. I then used yarn init inside of the same virtual environment when it was time to do the frontend. 

My other sites of interest are prek-eval-demo.herokuapp.com (a demo version of a site made for a client and posted with that clients permission), neyonajones.com which is a Wordpress site, and monsterdreamsbook.com which is a squarespace site for a book I wrote.
