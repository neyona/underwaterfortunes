This is the production code that is deployed on heroku forÂ https://underwaterfortunes.com. The site gives random funny fortunes and uses Django, React, Redux, etc.

It was made using a Django backend which also included Django Rest Framework, and the frontend was made using create-react-app.

MOST OF THE PICTURES WERE TAKEN OUT WHEN I PUT THIS ON GITHUB, they were in files labeled static and one file was in the public folder and the other was in the src folder.
